        "Depth of a leaf is defined by the number of inner-node necessary to reach that leaf. To be noted that the leaf itself is not counted. This is due to the fact that APD is to formulated to quantize the resource needs for the inference and a leaf does not require a comparison.\n",

        "From this formulation, it can be seen that the denominator of the probability is a constant and can be extracted from the summation. In addition, if we check each inner-node till reaching a leaf, depth change is adding only one. Therefore, calculation of the APD can be reformulated as:\n",
